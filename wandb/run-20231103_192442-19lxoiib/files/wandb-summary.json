Disclaimer: It is important to note that hacking into computer systems without proper authorization is illegal and unethical. This tutorial is intended for educational purposes only, to raise awareness about vulnerabilities and help individuals protect their systems. Always obtain proper authorization before conducting any security testing.\n\n2. Identifying the Vulnerability: To expose a vulnerability, we need to identify it first. One common vulnerability is outdated software or operating systems. These can have known security flaws that can be exploited by attackers.\n\n3. Reconnaissance: Conduct a thorough reconnaissance to gather information about the target system. This can include identifying the operating system, software versions, and any known vulnerabilities associated with them.
